== 12. Macros

image:../img/macros.jpg[]

"I never think about myself as an artist working in this time. I think about it in macro."
-- Frank Ocean


== Macros provide syntax

The "real" way to define a function:

    (def square
      (fn [x]
        (* x x)))

Special syntax:

    (defn square [x]
      (* x x))

Syntactic sugar to remove boilerplate

Macros extend the syntax of Clojure


== Macros expand

    (when (< x 2)
      (println "It's less than 2!")
      :ok)

Expands to

    (if (< x 2)
      (do
        (println "It's less than 2!")
        :ok))


== macroexpand-1 shows you what a macro does

    (macroexpand-1 '(when (< x 2)
                      (println "It's less than 2!")
                      :ok))
    => (if (< x 2)
         (do
           (println "It's less than 2!")
           :ok))


== Expanding defn

    (macroexpand-1
      '(defn square [x]
         (* x x)))
    => (def square
         (clojure.core/fn ([x] (* x x))))


== Macros produce code

* Functions that manipulate code
* Think of it as text manipulation
* Passed input forms unevaluated
* Replaces the form at compile time
* Have a `:macro` flag set in metadata


== Using macros

    (map
      (fn maybe-ok [x]
        (when (< x 2)
          :ok))
      (range 4))
    => (:ok :ok nil nil)

* `when` is only expanded once
* The form is expanded at compile time
* `maybe-ok` function is compiled to bytecode


== Macros do things functions cannot

* Arguments manipulated at compile time
* Arguments not evaluated
* Cannot be replaced by a function


== Functions do things macros cannot

    and
    => CompilerException: Can't take value of a macro

    (map and [true false]
             [true true])
    => CompilerException: Can't take value of a macro


* Macros are not values
* Cannot be passed to higher order functions
* Less useful than functions


== To use a macro as a function, wrap it in a function

    (map #(and %1 %2) [true false]
                      [true true])
    => (true false)


NOTE: Cannot apply arguments though...

    #(every? identity %&)


== Defining macros

    (defmacro infix [[operand1 op operand2]]
      (list op operand1 operand2))

    (infix (1 + 1))
    => 2

    (macroexpand '(infix (1 + 1)))
    => (+ 1 1)


== Defining macros

    (defmacro my-when [test & body]
      (list 'if test (cons 'do body)))

    (macroexpand-1
      '(my-when (< x 1)
         (println "hi")
         :ok))
    => (if (< x 1)
         (do
           (println "hi")
           :ok))

NOTE: `test` and `body` are values, `if` and `do` are symbols

== Macros using arguments

    (defmacro zen1 [x]
      (println "x:" x)
      x)
    (zen1 (+ 1 2))
    => x: (+ 1 2)
    3

vs

    (defn zen2 [x]
      (println "x:" x)
      x)
    (zen2 (+ 1 2))
    => x: 3
    3

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The input to `zen1` was a list
* For `zen1` `x` was a list
* We returned `x`
* But the final result was `3`
* The list was evaluated as a function call to `+`
* resulting in `3`
* The input to `zen2` was the result of evaluating the list
--


== Syntax quoting

    `(inc 1)
    => (clojure.core/inc 1)

* Special form called syntax-quote (also called back-quote)
* All symbols in a syntax-quote form get fully qualified
* ``` vs `'`


== Unquoting

    `(1 2 ~(+ 1 2) ~@(map inc [3 4 5]))
    => (1 2 3 4 5 6)

[options=header]
|===
|Syntax|Name|Behavior
l|`|Back-quote|Fully qualified quote
l|~|Unquote|Insert a value
l|~@|Unquote-splicing|Insert a sequence
|===


== Why fully qualify?

    (defmacro m1 []
      '(inc 1))

    (defmacro m2 []
      `(inc 1))

    (let [inc dec]
      {:m1 (m1)
       :m2 (m2)})

    => {:m1 0, :m2 2}

* Symbols have contextual meaning
* Macros are defined with no context


== Another source of naming collisions

    (defmacro bad [expr]
      (list 'let '[a 1]
        (list 'inc expr)))
    (bad 0)
    => 1
    (def a 0)
    (bad a)
    => 2

WARNING: The parameter name collided with the implementation

    (macroexpand-1 '(bad a))
    => (let [a 1] (inc a))


== Gensyms

    (defmacro good [expr]
      `(let [a# 1]
         (inc ~expr)))
    (good a)
    => 1
    (good 0)
    => 1

`a#` expands to a randomly generated symbol

    (macroexpand-1 '(good a))
    => (clojure.core/let [a__6500__auto__ 1]
         (clojure.core/inc a))


== Macro strategy

When working on a non-trivial macro a good strategy is:

* Step 1: Write a function!
* Step 2: Call your function from the macro

TIP: Keep the macro small and offload form transformations to other functions


== When should I write a macro?

Almost never

To provide new syntax: core.async

    (def echo-chan (chan))
    (go (println (<! echo-chan)))
    (>!! echo-chan "hello")
    => true
    hello


== Code as data

* Functions that produce code
* Manipulate code... as data
* Homoiconic: the language text has the same structure as its abstract syntax tree
* Code transformed using the same representation
* Nested code is well represented as a data structure
* Language can be extended conveniently
* Lisp "syntax" underpins Clojure "syntax"


== Reading macros is a useful skill

* Macros are common in clojure.core and libraries
* Macros can have surprising behavior
* Debugging
** Identifying macros
** Expanding macros


== Macro summary

* Manipulate the operand forms
* Do not evaluate the input forms
* Not functions
* Cannot be passed to other functions

== Answers

See clojure source code

    (defmacro or2
      ([] nil)
      ([x] x)
      ([x & next]
          `(let [or# ~x]
             (if or# or# (or ~@next)))))
