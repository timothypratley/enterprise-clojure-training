Clojure for Java Programmers - Rich Hickey

* Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb3rurFxrZ8

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Writing Clojure code requires more thinking and less typing than other languages
* Don't feel frustrated if the code comes slowly at first
* Being a great programmer requires thinking
* You will only reach your true potential expressing code in ways that empower you rather than constrain you
--


== Best practices

* Write tests
* Write expectation strings for tests
* Use lein-test-refresh
* Keep functions short and focused
  - Extract sub functions
  - Compose functions


== Best practices

* Keep namespaces short and focused
  - Extract related functions into new namespaces
  - Write doc-strings for namespaces
* Write doc-strings for functions
* Write doc-strings for defs when appropriate
* Follow the Clojure style guide


== Tips

* Build bottom up
* Start with data
* Create functions to operated on that data
* Eastwood can give hints on better expressions
* Read source code (Clojure, libraries, open source projects)


== Tips

* Most problems can be solved with a function
* Scientific method:
  - Think of things that could possibly be wrong
  - Isolate a small test case
  - Test one hypothesis at a time
* Finding Clojure libraries https://www.clojure-toolbox.com/


== Workflow

* Editor + Test refresh + REPL
* Reading stacktraces
** Try line 1
** Scan down for your namespace
* Small functions
* Test as you go
* Print things
* Test assumptions/hypothesis


== Editor customization

* After you feel comfortable with Clojure
* Paredit
* Parinfer
* Send file to REPL
* Send form to REPL


== Learn the many Clojure functions

* Set aside some recuring time to bite of bits of the API
* Clojure word of the day: https://clojure.me


== Read Clojure code

* Clojure source
* Clojure libraries
* Open source projects
* Check the source on anything new you use


== Style guide

https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide


== Eastwood

Produces suggestions on how to write idiomatic Clojure

`$HOME/.lein/profiles.clj`

    {:user {:plugins [[jonase/eastwood "0.2.5"]]}}

    $ lein eastwood


== Get help

* REPL can answer most questions
* StackOverflow.com #clojure
* Create minimal examples
* Clojure mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure
* ClojureVerse https://clojureverse.org
* Clojurians Slack http://clojurians.net


== Practice

* Challenges 1-4
* Small projects
* 4Clojure problems http://www.4clojure.com
* Project Euler https://projecteuler.net
* Katas
