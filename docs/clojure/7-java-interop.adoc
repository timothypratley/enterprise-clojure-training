== 7. Java Interop

"Sitting in my favorite coffeehouse with a new notebook and a hot cup of java is my idea of Heaven."
-- Libba Bray


== Clojure syntax for Java constructors

    (ns training.core
      (:import (java.util Date)))

    (Date.)
    (Date. 2018 02 17)

Which is equivalent to the less used variant:

    (new Date)
    (new Date 2018 02 17)


== Calling methods on a Java object

    (.length "hello world")
    (.isDirectory (java.io.File. "my-dir"))

Equivalent to the less used variant:

    (. "hello world" length)
    (. (java.io.File. "my-dir") isDirectory)


== Static and inner

Java static method calls:

    (Math/pow 1 2)
    (.print System/out "hi")

Inner classes:

    java.nio.channels.FileChannel$MapMode/READ_ONLY


== Initializing objects with doto

    (ns training.core
      (:import (java.util HashMap)))
    (doto (HashMap.)
      (.put "a" 1)
      (.put "b" 2))
    => {"a" 1, "b" 2}

We get the constructed object, with side-effects applied


== reify

`reify` creates an object that conforms to an interface:

    (.listFiles (java.io.File. ".")
      (reify
        java.io.FileFilter
        (accept [this f]
          (.isDirectory f))))

Notice that we did not define a class?


== gen-class and proxy

`gen-class` creates a class.

`proxy` extends a concrete superclass.

Rarely needed, refer to manual.


== Including Java classes in Clojure projects

You can define Java classes in Java in a separate directory and add

    :java-source-paths ["java-src"]

To your `project.clj` file

    lein compile

Java code in that directory will be usable from Clojure
