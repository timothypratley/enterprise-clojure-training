== 9. Polymorphism and Types

image:../img/types.jpg[]

"You need a lot of different types of people to make the world better."
-- Joe Louis


== Multimethods introduction

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
    (def my-square {:shape "square"})
    (defmulti draw :shape)
    (defmethod draw "square" [x]
      "Rendering a square...")
    (draw my-square)
    ;=> "Rendering a square..."

* Keywords are functions
* Common to use a keyword as a dispatch function
* Looks similar to Object Oriented type dispatch
* Users can add methods later


== Defining a multimethod

Polymorphic dispatch. Define the name and the dispatch function:

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
    (defmulti encounter
      (fn dispatch [a b]
        [(:species a) (:species b)]))
    ;=> #'encounter

* Dispatch is not limited to a single type
* Dispatch might not even involve a type


== Defining method implementations

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
    (defmethod encounter [:bunny :lion] [a b] :run-away)
    (defmethod encounter [:lion :bunny] [a b] :eat)
    (defmethod encounter [:lion :lion] [a b] :fight)
    (defmethod encounter [:bunny :bunny] [a b] :mate)
    ;=> #object[cljs.core.MultiFn]

* Similar to a case block
* Not limited to a single input
* Input is unused in this example


== Calling the multimethod

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
    (def bunny1 {:species :bunny, :other :stuff})
    (def bunny2 {:species :bunny, :other :stuff})
    (def lion1 {:species :lion, :other :stuff})
    (def lion2 {:species :lion, :other :stuff})
    (encounter bunny1 bunny2)
    ;=> :mate

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
    (encounter bunny1 lion1)
    ;=> :run-away

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
    (encounter lion1 bunny1)
    ;=> :eat

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
    (encounter lion1 lion2)
    ;=> :fight


== Multimethods summary

* Conditions under which to be called + function definitions
* Often dispatch by type, but not limited to that
* *Provide a point of extension*
** Clojure test reporter can be modified
** JDBC types can have custom handlers added


== Protocols also provide a point of extension

* Protocols directly implement host polymorphism (JVM)
** Dispatch on the type of their first argument
** Fast
* *User or library can add methods later*


== Protocols

    (defprotocol AProtocol
      "A doc string for AProtocol abstraction"
      (bar [a b] "bar docs")
      (baz [a] [a b] [a b c] "baz docs"))

* A named set of named methods and their signatures


== Protocols are similar to Java Interfaces

* No implementations are provided
* Dynamic
* Generates a corresponding interface with the same name
* The protocol will automatically work with instances of the interface
* A Java client can implement the protocol-generated interface


== deftype supports protocols directly

    (defprotocol P
      (foo [x])
      (bar [x] [x y]))

    (deftype T [a b c]
      P
      (foo [x] a)
      (bar [x] b)
      (bar [x y] (+ c y)))

    (bar (T. 1 2 3) 42)
    => 45

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* `bar` has 2 signatures
* `a`, `b`, `c` are constructor arguments
--


== reify

    (def obj (reify P
               (foo [this] 17)))
    (foo obj)
    => 17

* Creates an object that implements a protocol without defining a type
* Do not have to implement all protocol signatures
* Can also reify Java interfaces


== Cannot reify a class

* Java classes are closed
* Java interfaces cannot be extended


== extend

    (extend AType
      AProtocol
       {:foo an-existing-fn
        :bar (fn [a b] ...)
        :baz (fn ([a]...) ([a b] ...)...)}
      BProtocol
        {...}
    ...)

* The `fn` can presume first argument is instanceof `AType`
* You can implement a protocol on `nil`
* Default implementation of protocol with `Object`


== extend-type

    (extend-type MyType
      Countable
        (cnt [c] ...)
      Foo
        (bar [x y] ...)
        (baz ([x] ...) ([x y zs] ...)))

Expands into:

    (extend MyType
      Countable
       {:cnt (fn [c] ...)}
      Foo
       {:baz (fn ([x] ...) ([x y zs] ...))
        :bar (fn [x y] ...)})


== Protocols are extensible

* User or library can add functionality later
* Embrace the host (JVM or JavaScript)
* Use when extension is required
* Create when extension is anticipated


== Creating types with defrecord and deftype

* `deftype`, `defrecord`, and `reify` define implementations of abstractions, and instances of those implementations.
* Resist the urge to use them to define 'structured data' as you would define classes or structures in other languages.
* It is preferred to use the built-in datatypes (vectors, maps, sets) to represent structured data.


== deftype

    (deftype Circle [radius])
    (deftype Square [length width])

    (Circle. 10)
    (Square. 5 11)

    (->Circle 10)
    (->Square 5 11)

No protocol required


== defrecord

    (ns training.core
      (:import (java.net FileNameMap)))

    (defrecord Thing [a] FileNameMap
      (getContentTypeFor [this fileName]
        (str a "-" fileName)))

* Defines a record named `Thing`
* single field `a`
* `FileNameMap` interface
* `String getContentTypeFor(String fileName)`


== record constructor

    (def thing (Thing. "foo"))

    (instance? FileNameMap thing)
    => true

Call the method on the `thing` instance and pass `"bar"`:

    (.getContentTypeFor thing "bar")
    => "foo-bar"
