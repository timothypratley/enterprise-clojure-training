"What language is it that meets all the criteria? What language would I choose if I had to choose today? Probably Clojure!"
-- Robert Martin


== Clojure

* Data
* Functions
* A tool for thought
* Getting stuff done

== 2. Clojure Syntax

image:img/syntax.png[]

"If the syntax is good enough for the information, it should be good enough for the meta-information."
-- Erik Naggum


== Primitive data types

Strings are enclosed in double quotes

    "This is a string."

Character literals are preceded by a backslash

    \a \b \c \newline \tab

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Representing Numbers
* Automatically promoted on overflow only when using *' now
--

== Truthiness

* Booleans: `true` and `false`
* `nil` means nothing and is considered false in logical tests
* Anything else is truthy


== Lists

    ()

Evaluated as function calls

    (inc 1)
    => 2

    (quote (1 2))
    => (1 2)

    '(1 2)
    => (1 2)


== Sequences

Fundamental abstraction

    (seq? '(1 2 3))
    => true

Many sequence oriented functions

    (seq? (drop 1 '(1 2 3)))
    => true

    (seq? 8)
    => false

Lazy

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Can think of them as an efficient, immutable iterator
* Collections (not yet introduced, but list, vector, set, map) all implement seq
--

== Symbols

* Begin with an alphabet character
* Can contain numbers and punctuation
* Usually `lowercase-words-hyphenated`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Can think of them like the (identifiers, reserved keywords, operators) of other mainstream languages
--


== Resolving symbols

	inc
	=> #object[clojure.core$inc]

	foo
	=> Exception: Unable to resolve symbol foo

	'foo
	=> foo


== Vectors

    [1 2 3 4]

* Order 1 count and lookup by index
* Preferred over lists


== Equality

Identity and by value

    (= [1 2 3] '(1 2 3))
    => true

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Note to self: vectors and list can be equal because they are sequential
* A map cannot equal a set or a list/vector.  But maps and sets have not yet been introduced
--


== Maps

    {"name" "Fate of the Furious"
     "sequence-number" 8
     "rotten-tomatoes" 0.66
     "imdb" 0.67}

* Order 1 lookup, "add", "delete" by key
* Tuned to be fast
* Replacement for structs/objects
* Versatile; used often in Clojure code

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* There are fancier "versions" of maps in Clojure (records) to handle cases where you want faster Java interop or a strongly-typed name
* Records still "behave like a map" (implement the map interface)
* Maps are used instead of named function/method arguments in other languages
* Maps are used instead of value classes (immutable classes to hold data, impt for concurrent programming) because they are immutable
* For people from other languages, same as: dictionary (Python), hash (Ruby), object (JS), associative array (Perl)
--

== Keywords

* `:my-keyword`
* Shorthand identifiers
* Begin with a colon
* Often used as keys in hashmaps

    {:name "Fate of the Furious"
     :sequence-number 8
     :rotten-tomatoes 0.66
     :imdb 0.67}


== Namespaced keywords

    :timothy.example/rect

    ::rect
    => :timothy.example/rect

* shorthand for current namespace


== Sets

    #{1 2 3}

* Near constant time lookup


== Nesting

    {:name "Fate of the Furious"
     :sequence-number 8
     :ratings {
       :rotten-tomatoes 0.66
       :imdb 0.67}}

    {[1 2] {:name "diamond" :type :treasure}
     [3 4] {:name "dragon" :type :monster}}

* A map with vector coordinate keys, and map values


== Invoking functions

    (inc 1)
    => 2

* Prefix order


== Defining vars

    (def x)
    x
    => #object[clojure.lang.Var$Unbound "Unbound: #'user/x"]

    (def x 1)
    x
    => 1

* Global mutable reference (use sparingly)
* Dereferenced when evaluated

WARNING: Avoid re-def'ing after creating a binding

[NOTE.speaker]
--
example of def inside defn and why it is bad...
global mutable state, concurrent access
--

== Atoms

Change over time

    (def a (atom 1))
    (swap! a inc)
    @a
    => 2

    (deref a)
    => 2


== Let

    (let [x 1]
      (inc x))
    => 2

* Bind symbols to values in a scope
* Shadow existing bindings
* Prefer `let` over `def`


== Destructuring (binding forms)

    (let [[x y] [1 2]]
      (+ x y))
    => 3

* Literal data structure containing symbols
* Matches structure


== Destructuring

Avoids extracting substructure manually:

    (defn normalize1 [v]
      (let [x (first v)
            y (second v)
            length (Math/sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y)))]
        [(/ x length) (/ y length)]))

    (defn normalize2 [[x y]]
      (let [length (Math/sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y)))]
        [(/ x length) (/ y length)]))


== Destructuring

Available in any binding form

    (for [[k v] m]
      [v k])


== For expressions

    (for [i (range 10)]
      (* i i))
    => (0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81)

    (for [file ["a" "b" "c" "d"
                "e" "f" "g" "h"]
          rank (range 1 9)]
      (str file rank))
   => ("a1" "a2"..."a8" "b1"..."h8")

    (for [i (range 10)
          :when (odd? i)]
      (* i i))
    => (1 9 25 49 81)


== Variadic functions

Destructured using `&`

    (defn sub [& vs]
      vs)

    (sub 1 2 3 4)
    => (1 2 3 4)

* Variadic means variable number of arguments
* Arity means number of arguments
* We could have just passed a vector instead


== Apply

* Calls a function with a sequence of arguments

    (apply + [1 2 3 4])
    => 10

* Most mathematical functions are variadic:

    (+ 1 2 3)
    => 6


== Destructuring a map

    (def x {:field1 10 :field2 20})

    (:field1 x)
    (:field2 x)

    {:keys [field1 field2]} x

    {f1 :field1, f2 :field2} x

    (def y {"field1" 10 "field2" 20})

    {:strs [label1 label2]} y


== Destructuring a sequence:

    (first x)
    (rest x)

    [a & more]


== Nested destructuring

    (get-in movies [:ratings :imdb])

    {{imdb :imdb} :ratings} movies


== More destructuring

    :as x

    :or {field1 "default"}

* Prefer (merge defaults inputs) instead of :or


== Namespaces

    (ns training.core
      (:require [clojure.string :as string])
      (:import [java.util Date]))

    (string/upper-case "shout")

* First thing in a file
* Must match path and filename
* `training.core` in `src/training/core.clj`
* `-` replaced with `_` and `.` replaced with `/`
* Other forms exist, but prefer this one


== Programs

* Expressions which are evaluated to results
* If an expression needs to be compiled, it will be
* Can be loaded from files or evaluated dynamically
* Unit of compilation is a form


== Comments

Anything following a semicolon is a comment

    ; this is an inline comment
    ;; this is a function level comment

Less common is the comment form:

    (comment anything)

== Comments

Removal of next form `#_`

    #_(this form is removed)
    #_#_ ignored-1 ignored-2

* Temporarily remove a form when debugging code
* Looks like a bug eyes emoji


== Commas

Commas are optional and treated as whitespace

    (= {:a 1, :b 2, :c 3} {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})

Prefer newlines

    {:a 1
     :b 2
     :c 3}


== Regex

    #"pattern"

    (re-seq #"\w+" "the quick brown fox")
    => ("the" "quick" "brown" "fox")


== Exercises

See manual end of section 2


== Answers

Set up the new namespace called `training.syntax`

    (ns training.syntax)
    => nil

Define a var called `message` bound to the string `"greetings"`

    (def message "greetings")
    => #'hello-clojure/message


== Answers

Print out the value of the var `message`

    (prn message)
    => "greetings"
       nil

NOTE: `prn` keeps the quotes around strings; `println` does not


== Answers

Create a `let` binding that binds the symbol `message` to `"well hello there"`, and prints out `message` inside the `let` block:

    (let [message "well hello there"]
      (prn message))
    => "well hello there"
       nil

Print out message again, outside of the `let` block:

    (prn message)
    => "greetings"

NOTE: `message` global var is still the original value


== Answers

Create a let binding that destructures a map and prints the greeting and tone:

    (def m {:greeting "good morning", :tone "happy"})

    (let [{:keys [greeting tone]} m]
      (prn greeting tone))
    => "good morning" "happy"


== Answers

Destructure a single map input and return a string combining greeting and tone:

    (defn hi [{:keys [greeting tone]}]
      (str greeting " - " tone))

    (hi m)
    => "good morning - happy"


[state=title]
== 3. Functions

image:img/functions.jpg[]

"The chief function of the body is to carry the brain around."
-- Thomas A. Edison


== Defining functions

    (defn square [x]
      (* x x))

    (defn square
      "Multiplies a number by itself"
      [x]
      (* x x))


== Functions continued

* All functions return the last expression as a result
* Defn creates a var

    (square 2)
    => 4

* Mathematical operators in prefix notation

    (+ (square 2) (square 3))
    => 13

* Arguments are evaluated from left to right before the function is called


== Unnamed functions

    (fn [a]
      (inc a))

    #(inc %)

Unnamed; anonymous; Lambda (λ) expression


== Invoking anonymous functions

    ((fn [a] (inc a)) 1)
    =>2

    (#(inc %) 1)
    => 2

Just like a named function; first item in a list is applied


== Closure

Function that captures values from the environment

    (let [who "world"]
      (defn greet []
        (str "Hello " who)))
    (greet)
    => "Hello world"


== Passing a function to another function

    (defn do-triple [f]
      (f)
      (f)
      (f))

    (do-triple #(print "hot "))
    => hot hot hot nil

* Functions are values
* Can be passed to other functions
* Functions that take a function are called "higher order functions"


== Mapping a function over a sequence

WARNING: `map` the function, not `hash-map` the data structure

* Function that applies a function to every element in a sequence

    (map inc [1 2 3])
    => (2 3 4)

    (map (fn [x] (* x x)) [1 2 3 4])
    => (1 4 9 16)

* Don't need to create global definitions


== Map

    (defn greet-them [person]
      (str "Hello " person))

    (map greet-them ["Alice" "Bob" "Carol"])
    => ("Hello Alice" "Hello Bob" "Hello Carol")

* Using pre-defined functions is easy and readable


== Map

    (let [x 5]
      (map #(+ x %) [1 2 3]))
    => (6 7 8)

* Higher order function
* Closure as argument to higher order function
* Source of expressiveness


== Inline named functions

    (fn add-one [x]
      (inc x))

    add-one
    => Unable to resolve symbol: add-one in this context

* Does not create a global var
* Documents purpose
* Name appears in stacktraces (searchable clue)
* The function can call itself


== Named functions

    (defn f [x]
      (inc x))

Is shorthand for

    (def f
      (fn [x]
        (inc x)))


== Variadic arguments

    (defn f [& args]
      args)

    (f 1 2 3)
    => (1 2 3)

    (+ 1 2 3 4 5)
    => 15


== Variadic disadvantages

WARNING: Not always convenient

  (bake-cakes cake1 cake2 cake3)
  (let [cakes (db/find-cakes "delicious")]
    (apply bake-cakes cakes))

Prefer functions that do one thing

Combine with sequence operations

  (doseq [cake (db/find-cakes "delicious")]
    (bake-cake cake))


== Variadic disadvantages

WARNING: Bypasses arity checking

Common bad pattern:

    (defn f [x & [y]]
      (if y
        (+ x y)
        (inc x)))

    (f 1 2 3 4 "not a number")
    => 3


== Prefer explicit argument lists

    (defn f
      ([x] (inc x))
      ([x y] (+ x y)))

Multiple arities explicitly declared in parenthesis

    (f 1) => 2
    (f 1 2) => 3
    (f 1 2 3) => Exception: Wrong number of args


== Keyword arguments

    (defn f [& {:keys [port protocol]}]
      ...)
    (f :protocol "https")

NOTE: Destructure defaults with `:or`

    {:keys [port protocol] :or {port 8080, protocol "http"]}


== Keyword arguments

WARNING: Inconvenient

    (def config (edn/read-string (slurp "config.edn")))
    (apply f (apply concat config))

Pass a map instead

    (defn f [{:keys [option1 option2]}]
      ...)
    (f {:option3 "value"})
    (f config)


== Pre and post conditions

    (defn f [x]
      {:pre [(pos? x)]
       :post [(neg? %) (int? %)]}
      (- x))

    (f 1) => -1
    (f -1) => AssertionError Assert failed: (pos? x)
    (f 1.5) => AssertionError Assert failed: (int? %)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Assertions about inputs and outputs of a function
* Sequence of conditions
--


== Pre/Post drawbacks:

* Syntax is easy to get wrong, no assertion made
* Assertions can be disabled
* Less control over error reporting and handling
* Rarely used


== More common

Check for a condition and throw an exception

    (defn f [x]
      (when-not (pos? x)
        (throw (ex-info "bad input" {:x x}))
      (let [result (- x)]
        (if (and (neg? result) (int? result))
          result
          (throw (ex-info "bad result" {:x x})))

Or use spec


== Function literals

    #(inc %)

    #(+ %1 %2)

    #(apply + %&)

Terse, powerful expressions


== Compare

    (map #(* % %) [1 2 3 4])

    (map (fn square [x]
           (* x x))
         [1 2 3 4])

[TIP]
--
Prefer `(fn)` form

* Named parameter
* named purpose
* stack traces

== Challenge 1: Corgi Cover eligibility

Insuricorp is about to launch a marketing campaign for a new “corgi cover” policy. Only certain people are eligible to register for “corgi cover”. To be eligible they must own a corgi, live in either Illinois (IL), Washington (WA), New York (NY), or Colorado (CO). You are tasked with building a system to validate applications for the policy.


== Part 1:

Write a function that will take as input a state and corgi-count, and will return a boolean indicating the person's eligibility for the “corgi cover” policy.


== Test data
[style="literal", options="header"]
|===
|Name |State |Corgi count | Existing policy count
|Chloe |IL |1 |0
|Ethan |IL |4 |2
|Annabelle |WY |19 |0
|Logan |WA |2 |1
|===


== Part 2:

A focus group of corgi owners has revealed that “corgi cover” needs to be offered at 3 different tiers: “corgi cover silver”, “corgi cover gold”, and “corgi cover platinum”. Platinum is available when covering 7 or more corgis OR covering at least 3 corgis and also having one other policy with Insuricorp. Gold is available when covering at least 3 corgis. Silver is the original “corgi cover” policy. Create a new function that takes an additional argument policy-count and returns a keyword indicating their eligibility.

See `cond`


== Part 3:

The “corgi cover” applications Insuricorp collect contain more information than necessary to determine eligibility. Create a new function that takes as input a single map data structure as input instead of multiple inputs. It should pick out the values that it needs from the input map. Create some test data and feed it to your function. The data should look something like:

    {:name "Chloe", :state "IL", :corgi-count 1, :policy-count 0}


== Part 4:

Insuricorp just merged with Megacorp. Platinum level corgi cover is now offered to people with an existing Megacorp policy as well. Because the company is still restructuring, the policy-count input still only contains Insuricorp data. But a new input has been made available to you which is a map of people to policies.

    {"Chloe" ["secure goldfish"]
     "Ethan" ["cool cats cover" "megasafe"]}

Create a new function that takes as inputs two maps: the application, and the existing policies. It should apply the same logic, but make use of the Megacorp data.

== 4. Testing with clojure.test

image:img/testing.jpg[]

"The problem is not that testing is the bottleneck. The problem is that you don’t know what’s in the bottle."
-- Michael Bolton


== deftest

    (ns training.my-namespace-test
      (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]))

    (deftest my-test
      (prn "My test ran"))

    (my-test)
    => "My test ran"
    nil

Tests are functions with no input arguments


== Defining tests with deftest

Can define tests in any namespace

Convention: `*test*` dir mirrors `*src*` dir, append `*_test*`


|===
|`*test*/training/my_namespace_test.clj`
|`*src*/training/my_namespace.clj`
|===


== Refer all

Common to refer all symbols from `clojure.test` for convenience:

    (ns training.my-namespace-test
      (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]))
    (deftest ...)

vs

    (ns training.my-namespace-test
      (:require [clojure.test :as test]))
    (test/deftest ...)


== Running tests from the REPL

    (run-tests)

    => "My test ran"

       0 failures, 0 errors.
       {:test 1, :pass 0, :fail 0, :error 0, :type :summary}

Runs all tests in the current namespace

Or if you want to test specific namespaces:

    (run-tests 'training.my-namespace
               'training.other-namespace)


== Command line testing

       Ran 0 tests containing 0 assertions.
       0 failures, 0 errors.
       {:test 1, :pass 0, :fail 0, :error 0, :type :summary}

Runs all tests in a project


== lein-test-refresh

* Reloads code and runs tests when you save a file
* Leiningen plugin

Add lein-test-refresh to your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

    {:user
     {:plugins
      [[com.jakemccrary/lein-test-refresh "0.22.0"]]}}


== lein-test-refresh

Alternatively as a `project.clj` dependency:

    (defproject sample
      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]]
      :profiles
      {:dev
       {:plugins
        [[com.jakemccrary/lein-test-refresh "0.22.0"]]}})


== Using lein-test-refresh

	$ lein test-refresh

Watches for changes from the command line

Change `my-test` to print a new message

Tests are re-run as soon as you save the file

	(deftest my-test
	  (prn "My test ran immediately"))

Use lein-test-refresh like a REPL

== Assertions

	(deftest inc-adds-one-test
	  (is (= 2 (inc 1))))

	=> Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions.
    0 failures, 0 errors.

* `(= expected actual)`
* Expected: value literal
* Actual: result of invoking the function under test


== Failures

	(deftest broken-test
	  (is (= 1 (inc 1))))

	=> FAIL in (broken-test)
    expected: (= 1 (inc 1))
      actual: (not (= 1 2))


== Can use any truthy assertion

    (deftest odd-test
      (is (odd? 1)))

    (deftest create-test
      (is (create-thing)))


== Describing the assertions

    (deftest pythag-test
      (is (= (* 5 5)
             (+ (* 3 3) (* 4 4)))
          "The square of the hypotenuse
          is equal to the sum of the squares
          of the other two sides"))


== Comparing complex values

    expected: (= {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:fo :bar, :baz :quux})
      actual: (not (= {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:fo :bar, :baz :quux}))

Huh?

    expected: {:foo :bar, :baz :quux}
      actual: {:fo :bar, :baz :quux}
        diff: - {:foo :bar}
              + {:fo :bar}

`pjstadig/humane-test-output` (or `venantius/ultra`)

== Humane test output

== Grouping assertions

    (deftest math-test
      (testing "Basic math"
        (is (odd? 1))
        (is (= 2 (inc 1))))
      (testing "Pythagoras"
        (is (= (* 5 5)

            "The square of the hypotenuse
            is equal to the sum of the squares
            of the other two sides"))


== are

    (are [x y] (= x y)
         2 (+ 1 1)
         4 (* 2 2))

Concisely expresses multiple assertions

WARNING: Disadvantages

* Easy to make an error in the syntax
* Overly terse
* Line numbers are not preserved (harder to find the failing test)


== Should throw an exception

    (defn maybe-inc [x]
      (if (= 42 x)
        (throw (ex-info "oh no" {}))
        (inc x)))

    (deftest test-maybe-inc-throws
      (is (thrown? Exception
            (maybe-inc 42)))
      (is (thrown-with-msg? Exception #"oh no"
            (maybe-inc 42))))


== Test fixtures

    (use-fixtures :each
      (fn print-enter-exit [tests]
        (println "before")
        (tests)
        (println "after")))

* A fixture is just a function
* Takes a test and calls it (tests are functions)
* Set up and tear down resources (database connections etc)
* `:each` means run for every test in the namespace

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Test runner will call the fixture

* prints “before”
* executes the tests in the namespace
* prints “after”
--


== Every vs once

    (use-fixtures :once
      (fn capture-prints [f]
        (with-out-str (f))))

* This fixture captures output, prevents clutter
* `:once` per namespace


== Fixtures

* Common use case is when doing database tests
* Wrap the test execution inside a transaction
* Rollback after the test completes
* Avoids the need to clean up data


== Mocking

    (defn post [url]
      {:body (str "Hello world")})

    (deftest test-post
      (with-redefs [str (fn [& args]
                           "Goodbye world")]
        (is (= {:body "Goodbye world"}
               (post "http://service.com/greet")))))

NOTE: `let` does not suffice, `str` is outside of scope


== Mocking

* Replace any var using `with-redefs`
* Disable dependencies during the test
* Isolate particular behaviors
* Test exceptional conditions
** always throw
** never throw


== Debugging

Print out an intermediary values

    (defn shazam [a b]
      (/ 1 (+ a b) (+ a (* a b))))

What is `(+ a (* a b))` evaluating to? `(doto ... (prn))`

    (defn shazam [a b]
      (/ 1 (+ a b) (doto (+ a (* a b)) (prn "***"))))

    (shazam 1 2)
    => 3 "***"
       1/9

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* `prn` will not work, always returns `nil`
* `doto` causes side-effect to occur, and return the original argument
--


== doto

Also useful for Java interop:

    (doto (new java.util.HashMap)
      (.put "a" 1)
      (.put "b" 2))
    => {"a" 1, "b" 2}

We get the constructed object, with side-effects applied


== Debugging

* Ask the REPL questions
* Build small incremental functions
* Write tests

== 5. Control Flow

image:img/control.jpg[]

"Control your own destiny or someone else will."
-- Jack Welch


== Conditionals: if

    (if (pos? 1)
      "one is positive"
      "or is it?")
    => "one is positive"

* Chooses between two options
* Returns a result
* Only one branch is evaluated
* A function call evaluates all arguments


== Conditionals: when

    (when (pos? 1)
      (println "one is positive")
      (println "multiple expressions allowed")
      :ok)
    => one is positive
       multiple expressions allowed
       :ok

* Executes code only when a condition is met
* When test fails, nothing is evaluated
* When test passes, the entire body is evaluated
* Returns a result


== Conditionals: cond

    (def x {:cake 1})

    (cond (= x 1) "one"
          (= x :cake) "the cake is a lie"
          (map? x) "it's a map!"
          :else "not sure what it is")
    => "it's a map!"

* Multiple branches
* `:else` is not special, keywords are truthy
* See also `condp` and `case`


== But what are they?

* Special forms: Built in primitives, not functions
* `def`, `let`, `quote` and `fn` are special forms
* Don't evaluate their arguments


== Recursion

Functions that call themselves are called recursive

    (defn sum-up [coll result]
      (if (empty? coll)
        result
        (sum-up (rest coll) (+ result (first coll)))))

== Tail Call Optimization

Recursion which avoids consuming the stack

    (defn sum-up-with-recur [coll result]
      (if (empty? coll)
        result
        (recur (rest coll) (+ result (first coll)))))

* Recur can only occur where a function returns
* Stack can be discarded


== Loops

    (loop [a 0
           b 1]
      (if (< b 1000)
        (recur b (+ a b))
        a))

* Loop establishes bindings
* Allows recur to the start of the loop
* Can almost always be expressed as functions

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Example of a situation in which loop becomes necessary:

If you want to print the duplicates of a collection, you can use `distinct`.  If
you want to print just the values that appear more than / only once, you can use
`frequencies`.

But if want to print only the repeat occurrences of distinc tvalues in a
collection (skip the 1st, print the 2nd, 3rd, etc.), then it gets more complex.
You need to keep track of which values have been seen so far when visiting each
element, so `map` is not sufficient.  `reduce` avoids that problem since it has
an accumulator, but since you need to return a seq in the end while keeping
track of previously seen values, `reduce` is more awkward than just using `loop`
here.

(loop [unseen-vals original-vals
       seen-val-set #{}
       repeat-occurrences []]
  (if (empty? unseen-vals)
    repeat-occurrences
    (let [next-val (first unseen-vals)]
      (if (contains? seen-val-set next-val)
        (recur (rest unseen-vals) seen-val-set (conj repeat-occurrences next-val))
        (recur (rest unseen-vals) (conj seen-val-set next-val) repeat-occurrences)))))
--

== Exception handling

Special forms `try` `catch` `finally` and `throw`

    (try
      (inc "cat")
      (catch Exception e
        (println "cat cannot be incremented"))
      (finally
        (println "always"))

[state=title]
== 6. Functional Programming

image:img/functional.jpg[]

"If you don't love something, it's not functional, in my opinion."
-- Yves Behar


== Functions recap

Functions always return a value

* Usually not `nil`
* `(inc 1)` -> `2`
* `(println "hi")` -> `nil` causes a side-effect
* All Input/Output is considered a side-effect

== Pure functions

    (str "hi" "there")
    => "hithere"

* No side-effects occur
* Inputs always produce the same corresponding output


== Side effects

    (rand-int 100)
    => 42

* Not a pure function
* Returns a useful result, but changes every time
* Modifying a hidden state

== Side effects

    (def x 1)

* Returns a var
* Side-effect: `x` can now be resolved


== Side effects are useful

* Databases
* Files
* User interfaces


== Many Clojure functions are pure

    (conj [1 2] 3)
    => [1 2 3]

* `conj` does not add something to a vector
* `conj` returns a new vector value


== Persistent data structures

* Clojure implements efficient immutable data structures
* Creating derivative values is cheap
* Using a Java vector would require duplicating the vector
* Clojure uses shared structure


== Pure functions are desirable

* easier to reason about
* easier to combine
* easier to test
* easier to debug
* easier to parallelize


== How can you change a variable?

    (def v [1 2])
    (conj v 3)
    => [1 2 3]

    v
    => [1 2]

* `v` remained unchanged
* Manage change explicitly


== Separate side effects out

* Keep side-effects co-located
* See atoms:
  - Pure function to calculate the next state
  - Atom to manage
  - Logic is separate from the side effect
* Keep logic pure


== apply

Given 4 numbers we can call

    (max 1 2 5 3)
    => 5

What if you have a sequence of many numbers?

    (def numbers [1 2 3 4 5 6 7])

    (apply max numbers)
    => 7


== apply

* Useful when calling variadic functions like max
* The term apply means call or invoke


== partial

In Clojure we often pass functions as values

    (partial + 1)

Returns a function that is equivalent to:

    (fn [& args]
      (apply + 1 args))

* captures an argument
* partial application


== partial returns a new function

Produces a function:

    ((partial + 1) 2 3)
    => 6

    (map (partial / 1) (range 1 5))
    => (1 1/2 1/3 1/4)

Alternatively:

    (map #(/ 1 %) (range 1 5))
    => (1 1/2 1/3 1/4)


== Functions on sequences

To embrace Clojure

is to think in sequences and data structures


== Sequences

    (cons 1 ())
    => (1)

    (cons 3 (cons 2 (cons 1 ())))
    => (3 2 1)

    (range 10)
    => (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)


== Careful

Clojure can produce infinite sequences

    (range)

* Don't do this in the REPL
* Press control-c to cancel the REPL if you did


== take and drop

Limit the number of items to consume:

    (take 5 (range))
    => (0 1 2 3 4)

    (take 5 (drop 5 (range)))
    => (5 6 7 8 9)


== filter and remove

    (filter odd? [1 2 3 4])
    => (1 3)

    (remove nil? [1 2 nil 3])
    => (1 2 3)

* filter and remove are higher order functions
* They take a function and a sequence
* They return a sequence of values


== Most things are seqable

    (seq #{"a" "b" "c"})
    => ("a" "b" "c")

    (seq "string")
    => (\s \t \r \i \n \g)

    (seq {:a 1, :b 2})
    => ([:a 1] [:b 2])

Clojure collections implement `ISeq`


== Empty sequences

`seq` returns `nil` on empty sequences

    (seq ())
    => nil

    (empty? ())
    => true

Prefer `(seq xs)` over `(not (empty? xs))`


== map

`map` calls a function for every element in a sequence:

	(map inc [1 2 3 4])
	=> (2 3 4 5)

* `map` `inc` over `[1 2 3 4]`
* Result is a sequence
* Not to be confused with the map datastructure
* Name is similar, behavior is similar keys -> values


== map over multiple sequences

    (map + [1 2 3] [10 10 10])
    => [11 12 13]


== Composing sequences

Sequences can input for other functions:

    (filter odd? (map inc [1 2 3 4]))
    => (3 5)

Keeps odd numbers from the result of `map` `inc`


== Compose

    (g (f x))

"compose" really just means "put together"

Composition is aided by

* Idempotence
* Immutability
* Purity


== Aggregate with reduce

Reduce takes a function, initial value, and sequence:

    (reduce * 1 [2 3 4])
    => 24

Performs `(* 1 2)`, then `(* 3)`, then `(* 4)`

Multiplication called 3 times

    (reduce * [1 2 3 4])
    => 24

The initial value can be left out, if so it is the first element


== reduce

    (reduce
      (fn step [acc x]
        (* acc x))
      1
      (range 2 5))
    => 24

* Step function takes 2 arguments; aggregate and item
* Step function called for every item
* Aggregate returned
* Aggregate can be anything... commonly a map

[NOTE.speaker]
--
add map example
--


== group-by

    (group-by count ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox"])
    => {3 ["the" "fox"], 5 ["quick" "brown"]}

* Produced a map
* 3 letter words ["the" "fox"]
* 5 letter words ["quick" and "brown"]
* Can we do this with reduce?
* `frequencies`


== Sequences are loop abstractions

`filter` is like a Java loop:

    for (i=0; i < vector.length; i++)
	    if (condition)
	        result.append(vector[i]);

`map` is like a Java loop:

    for (i=0; i < vector.length; i++)
        result[i] = func(vector[i]);

`reduce` is like a Java loop:

    for (i=0; i < vector.length; i++)
        result = func(result, vector[i]);


== Sequence abstractions

* Names for loops
* Adds to our vocabulary
* Recognize different kinds of loops
* Worth the effort to learn
  - Reasoning more succinctly
  - Communicating more precisely
  - Writing less code that does more


== Sequences and lambda expressions

Anonymous functions:

    #(< % 3)

Handy for adding small snippets of logic:

	(filter #(< % 3) (range 10))
	=> (0 1 2)

	(map #(if (odd? %) "odd" "even") [1 2 3 4 5])
	=> ("odd" "even" "odd" "even" "odd")

More concise, descriptive, composable than loops


== Creating sequences

	(range 5)
	=> (0 1 2 3 4)

	(repeat 3 1)
	=> (1 1 1)

	(partition 3 (range 9))
	=> ((0 1 2) (3 4 5) (6 7 8))


== Transpose

    (apply map vector [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]])
    => [[1 4]
        [2 5]
        [3 6]]


== Tricky

Common situation in Java:

	for (i=1; i < v.length; i++)
	    print v[i] + v[i-1];
	=> 3 5 7 9

Using the previous value in the sequence

Can we represent this as a sequence?

Imagine two identical sequences offset slightly:

	  [1 2 3 4 5]
	[1 2 3 4 5]


== map over both sequences

Recall that `map` can take multiple sequences:

    (map + [1 3] [2 4])
    => (3 7)

`rest`:

    (def v [1 2 3 4 5])
    (rest v)
    => (2 3 4 5)

Put them together:

	(map + v (rest v))
	=> (3 5 7 9)


== Visually

	v        => (1 2 3 4 5)
	(rest v) => (2 3 4 5)

* Sequences are of different lengths
* map stops when the smallest sequence is exhausted
* Produces a new sequence of the pairwise sums:

	(3 5 7 9)


== Sequences beat loops

* Must comprehend the entire loop
* Loop bodies grow and change -> more complexity
* Loop “off by one” mistakes
* Testing loops requires invasion
* Duplication of loops to customize similar operations
* Loops are not composable
* Loops are easy to write, but do not provide leverage


== New requirements

Multiply all of those numbers together

	result = 1;
	for (i=1; i < v.length; i++)
	    result *= (v[i] + v[i-1]);
	=> 945

* Invasive to the imperative loop
* The change occurs inside the loop
* Intertwined


== Sequence solution

Compose `reduce` with the original `map` expression:

	(reduce * (map + v (rest v)))
	=> 945

* `reduce`: Aggregate by multiplication the sequence
* `map`: adding items together from two sequences
* `pairing`: the sequence of elements in v, adjacent to the rest of v

This is dense, but descriptive code... if you know the vocabulary


== Sequence solution

* Unit test operations
* Unit test the component sequences
* Reuse sequences
* Reason about transformations as composable parts


== Sequences summary

Sequences are loop abstractions that allow you to ignore the implementation details

* `filter` keeps items in a sequence according to a predicate
* `map` calls a function over input sequence(s)
* `reduce` aggregates a sequence, returns a single value


== The “no loops” challenge

* Spot a loop
* Stop and think about what the loop represents
* Rewrite the loop as sequence operations instead


== Threading operators: why?

	(reduce * (filter odd? (map inc v)))
	=> 15

* Functions offer combinatorial power
* Simple functions + sequence operations
* To read this code, work from inside out
* Finding the inside is a challenge

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* But be wary of dense code
* Layers make the code cryptic!
--

== Solution: order forms inside first

Name intermediary results:

	(let [incs (map inc v)
	      odd-incs (filter odd? incs)]
	  (reduce * odd-incs))
	=> 15

== Or use a thread last

	(->> v
	     (map inc)
	     (filter odd?)
	     (reduce *))
	=> 15

* Unwraps nested function calls
* Avoids naming steps
* Sometimes good, sometimes bad


== Thread first

Similar to thread last, passes value in first position:

    (-> 42
        (/ 2)
        (inc))
    => 22

For empty expressions, the parens are optional:

    (-> 42
        (/ 2)
        inc)
    => 22


== Data structures are functions

    (get {:a 1 :b 2} :a)
    => 1

    ({:a 1 :b 2} :a)
    => 1

    (map {:a 1, :b 2} [:a :b])
    => (1 2)

* Maps are functions
* They delegate to `get`


== Keywords are functions

    (:a {:a 1 :b 2})
    => 1

    (map :a [{:a 1} {:a 2} {:a 3}])
    => (1 2 3)

`get` `:a` for each element in a sequence

Instead of

    (map (fn [m] (get m :a)) [{:a 1} {:a 2} {:a 3}])
    => (1 2 3)


== Sets are functions

    (get #{1 2 3} 2)
    => 2

    (#{1 2 3} 2)
    => 2

    (remove #{nil "bad"} [:a nil :b "bad" "good"])


== Vectors are functions

    (get [1 2 3] 0)
    => 1

    ([1 2 3] 0)
    => 1


== Defaults

`get` can be passed a `not-found` value:

    (get {} :a "default")
    => "default"

Datastructures as functions do too:

    ({:a 1, :b 2} :c -1)
    => -1

== Challenge 2: Processing files

Insuricorp branches collect applications for the “corgi cover” policy and periodically send them to headquarters in a large comma separated text file.
You have been tasked with processing the files using the validation logic you built earlier.


== Part 1:

Create a function that opens a file called corgi-cover-applications.csv and converts every row into a data structure and prints it.
Next use that data structure as an input to your validation function and print the result.
See `slurp` `line-seq` `clojure.string/split`.


== Part 2:

The downstream Insuricorp systems will only be operating on corgi cover applications that pass your eligibility check.
But the invalid corgi cover applications need to be sent back to the branches so that they can follow up with the customers on why they are not eligible.
Create a new function that opens two output files and writes to them based upon your eligibility check.
The files should be called `eligible-corgi-cover-applications.csv` and `ineligible-corgi-cover-applications.csv`.


== Part 3:

A request has come in from several Insuricorp branches that if a person is ineligible for corgi cover, a short reason be supplied. That way the sales reps don't have to spend time figuring out what they need to tell the customer. Create a new validation function that instead of returning a boolean, returns nil if no problems are found, or returns a string with the reason if a problem is found. Create a new processing function that splits the applications into two files based on the new validator.


== Part 4:

As part of the Megacorp merger, the downstream systems are converting to JSON format.
Create a new function that writes JSON data to a eligible-corgi-cover-applications.json file

== 7. Macros

image:img/macros.jpg[]

"I never think about myself as an artist working in this time. I think about it in macro."
-- Frank Ocean


== Macros defn

    (def square
      (fn [x]
        (* x x)))

rearranged

    (defn square [x]
      (* x x))


== Macro when

    (if (< x 2)
      (do
        (println "It's less than 2!")
        :ok))

rearranged

    (when (< x 2)
      (println "It's less than 2!")
      :ok)


== Macros

* Arguments manipulated at compile time
* Arguments not evaluated
Macros allow us to extend the syntax of Clojure


== Expanding macros

* Macros expand to produce new code
* The form is expanded at compile time

Expansion:

    (macroexpand-1 '(defn square [x] (* x x)))
    => (def my-namespace/square
         (clojure.core/fn
           ([my-namespace/x]
            (clojure.core/*
              my-namespace/x my-namespace/x))))


== Macro drawbacks

    and
    => CompilerException: Can't take value of a macro

    (map and [true false] [true true])
    => CompilerException: Can't take value of a macro


* Not values
* Cannot be passed to higher order functions
* Less useful than functions


== Defining macros

    (defmacro zen1 [x]
      (println "x:" x) x)
    (zen1 (+ 1 2))
    => x:(+ 1 2)
    3

vs

    (defn zen2 [x]
      (println "x:" x) x)
    (zen2 (+ 1 2))
    => x:3
    3

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The input to `zen1` was a list
* For `zen1` `x` was a list
* We returned `x`
* But the final result was `3`
* The list was evaluated as a function call to `+`
* resulting in `3`

* The input to `zen2` was the result of evaluating the list
--


== Macros

* Have a `:macro` flag set in metadata
* Passed the input forms unevaluated
* Compiler replaces form
* Clojure evaluation occurs on the expanded form


== Syntax quoting

    `(inc 1)
    => (clojure.core/inc 1)

* Special form called syntax-quote (also called back-quote)
* All symbols in a syntax-quote form get fully qualified
* ``` vs `'`


== Unquoting

    `(1 2 ~(+ 1 2) ~@(map inc [3 4 5]))
    => (1 2 3 4 5 6)

[options=header]
|===
|Syntax|Name|Behavior
l|`|Back-quote|Fully qualified quote
l|~|Unquote|Insert a value
l|~@|Unquote-splicing|Insert a sequence
|===


== Why fully qualify?

Symbols may have another meaning in the context:

    (defmacro m1 []
      '(inc 1))

    (defmacro m2 []
      `(inc 1))

    (let [inc dec]
      {:m1 (m1)
       :m2 (m2)})

    => {:m1 0, :m2 2}

Syntax quote avoids colliding with the `let` bindings


== Another source of collisions

    (defmacro bad [expr]
      (list 'let '[a 1]
        (list 'inc expr)))
    (bad 0)
    => 1
    (def a 0)
    (bad a)
    => 2

WARNING: The parameter name collided with the implementation

    (macroexpand-1 '(bad a))
    => (let [a 1] (inc a))



== Gensyms

    (defmacro good [expr]
      `(let [a# 1]
         (inc ~expr)))
    (good a)
    => 1
    (good 0)
    => 1

`a#` expands to a randomly generated symbol

    (macroexpand-1 '(good a))
    => (clojure.core/let [a__6500__auto__ 1]
         (clojure.core/inc a))


== Code as data

* Really writing a function that produces code
* The output is code... as data
* We manipulate code... as data
* Homoiconic means that the language text has the same structure as its abstract syntax tree (AST)
* Code in the language can be transformed as data using the same representation
* Nested code is well represented as a data structure


== Macro stragegy

When working on a non-trivial macro a good strategy is:

* Step 1: Write a function!
* Step 2: Call your function from the macro

TIP: Keep the macro small and offload form transformations to other functions


== Macro summary

* Manipulate the operand forms
* Do not evaluate the input forms
* Not functions
* Cannot be passed to other functions

== 8. Parallel Programming and Concurrency

image:img/parallel.jpg[]

"Our moral traditions developed concurrently with our reason, not as its product."
-- Friedrich August von Hayek


== Vars and dynamic scope

    (def one-hundred 100)
    => #'training.core-test/one-hundred

    (var one-hundred)
    => #'training.core-test/one-hundred

    (deref #'one-hundred)
    => 100

* Vars are automatically derefed when evaluated
* Behavi a variable
* See the var itself using the var function or #' shorthand
* Functions defined with defn are stored in Vars
* Allows the re-definition of functions at runtime


== Metadata

Examine the metadata of a var:

    (meta #'one-hundred)
    => {:line 73, :column 1, ...}

Metadata provided using `^{}`

    (def x ^{:private true} 1)

You can attach whatever metadata you wish. These are the keys the compiler looks for:

    :private
    :doc
    :author
    :type


== Dynamic vars

* By default Vars are static
* Can be marked as dynamic to allow per-thread bindings
* Per thread they obey a stack discipline

	(def ^:dynamic x 1)
	(def ^:dynamic y 1)
	(+ x y)
	=> 2

	(binding [x 2 y 3]
	         (+ x y))
	=> 5

	(+ x y)
	=> 2


* Bindings cannot be seen by any other thread
* Bindings can be assigned to


== Delays, Futures, and Promises

* Wrap an arbitrary body of code for evaluation
* Executes at a later stage
* Run only if the answer is asked for
* Delays also cache the result value
* Prevents another execution
* Body only runs once, even concurrently


== Delays

    (def d (delay (println "Hello world!") 42))

    d
    => #object[clojure.lang.Delay {:status :pending, :val nil}]

    (realized? d)
    => false

    @d
    => Hello world!
       42

    @d
    => 42

    (realized? d)
    => true


== Futures

* Easy way to spin off a new thread
* Do some computation or I/O
* Access in the future
* Call style is compatible with delay
* Work begins immediately on another thread
* Flow of control is not blocked
* Dereferencing a future will block until the value is available


== Futures

    (def f
      (future (Thread/sleep 10000) 42))

    f
    => #object[clojure.core$future_call {:status :pending, :val nil}]


    (realized? f)
    => false

--- 10 seconds pass ---

    (realized? f)
    => true

    @f
    => 42

    f
    #object[clojure.core$future_call {:status :ready, :val 42}]


== Promises

* Used in a similar way to delay or future
* Dereference them for a value
* Check if they have a value with `realized?`
* Block when you dereference them until they have a value
* Don't immediately give them a value
* Provide them with one by calling deliver


== Promises

    (def p (promise))
    (realized? p)
    => false

    (deliver p "as-promised")
    (realized? p)
    => true

    @p
    => "as-promised"


== Atoms

    (def a (atom 1))
    (swap! a inc)
    @a
    => 2

* Manage shared, synchronous, independent state
* Reference type like refs and vars
* Create an atom with `atom`
* Access state with `deref`/`@`
* Change the value of an atom with `swap!` or `reset!`
* Changes to atoms are always free of race conditions


== Atoms

* Atomic
* `swap!` reads the current value, applies the function to it, and attempts to `compare-and-set!` it in
* Since another thread may have changed the value, it may have to retry
* Retries in a spin loop
* Net effect: the value will always be the result of the function
* Function might be called multiple times, it must be free of side effects
* Suitable for uncoordinated state
* Synchronous changes


== Refs

    (def r (ref 1))
    (dosync
      (alter r inc))
    @r
    => 2

* Vars ensure safe use of mutable storage locations via thread isolation, transactional references
* Refs ensure safe shared use of mutable storage locations via a software transactional memory (STM) system
* Refs are bound to a single storage location for their lifetime
* Only allow mutation of that location to occur within a transaction
* In practise Refs are rarely used


== Agents

    (def a (agent 1))
    (send a inc)
    @a
    => 2

    (send-off a (fn [x] (do-some-io))

* Like Refs, Agents provide shared access to mutable state
* Refs support coordinated, synchronous change of multiple locations
* Agents provide independent, asynchronous change of individual locations
* `send` should be used for actions that are CPU limited
* `send-off` is appropriate for actions that may block on IO
* Agents are integrated with the STM

== 9. Java Interop

image:img/interop.jpg[]

"Sitting in my favorite coffeehouse with a new notebook and a hot cup of java is my idea of Heaven."
-- Libba Bray


== Clojure syntax for Java constructors

Constructing a Java object is done by appending a period to the class identifier:

    (ns training.core
      (:import [java.util Date]))

    (Date.)
    (Date. 2018 02 17)

Which is equivalent to the less used variant:

    (new Date)
    (new Date 2018 02 17)


== Calling methods

Calling a method on a Java object done by prepending a leading period:

    (.length "hello world")
    (.isDirectory (java.io.File. "my-dir"))

Which is equivalent to the less used variant:

    (. "hello world" length)
    (. (java.io.File. "my-dir") isDirectory)

Java static method calls are accessed by slash:

    (Math/pow 1 2)
    (.print System/out "hi")

Inner classes can be accessed using the dollar symbol:

    java.nio.channels.FileChannel$MapMode/READ_ONLY


== reify

`reify` creates an object that conforms to an interface:

    (.listFiles (java.io.File. ".")
      (reify
        java.io.FileFilter
        (accept [this f]
          (.isDirectory f))))

Notice that we did not define a class?


== gen-class and proxy

`gen-class` creates a class. In practise the need to create a class from within Clojure is rare, so we won't be covering the syntax.
(see https://kotka.de/blog/2010/02/gen-class_how_it_works_and_how_to_use_it.html if you want to explore this further)

`proxy` can be used to extend a concrete superclass. Again the need for this is rare.
(see https://kotka.de/blog/2010/03/proxy_gen-class_little_brother.html if you want to explore this further)


== Including Java classes in Clojure projects

You can define Java classes in Java in a separate directory and add

    :java-source-paths ["java-src"]

To your `project.clj` file
(See https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/MIXED_PROJECTS.md for more other options.)


== Challenge 3: Mocking parallel web requests

Insuricorp and Megacorp are integrating their IT systems. As part of this effort you need to modify the “Corgi cover” eligibility logic to call a remote web service. Your task is to set up the code and tests.


== Part 1: Mock a web request

Every Insuricorp “Corgi cover” policy application needs to be cross referenced with Megacorp to see if the customer has a Megacorp policy already via a remote web service. The web service is not available for you to test against yet. Set up a function called fetch-megacorp-policies to do the web request but leave the implementation empty. Create a test that changes the behavior of fetch-megacorp-policies to behave as though it were a web request; make it pause for 100ms before returning the policies that the person has. Set up a test that exercises the eligibility checks using the mocked version of a web request.


== Part 2: Report the how long it takes

In Java you might write something like this:

    long startTime = System.nanoTime();
    // ... the code being measured ...
    long estimatedTime = System.nanoTime() - startTime;

Implement a similar solution in Clojure.


== Part 3: Make parallel requests

The web service you are using can handle multiple requests faster than a series of requests. It operates fastest with up to 20 connections. Modify your code such that multiple requests are made simultaneously. Compare the timing results to confirm the operations are happening in parallel.


== Part 4: Error handling

Modify your mock of fetch-megacorp-policies such that it throws an exception randomly about 10% of the time. Make sure your tests report a failure. Now update your logic to handle the errors and retry up to 10 times. The tests should pass. Then create another test where the exception is thrown 100% of the time, and the max tries occurs.

== 10. Polymorphism and Types

image:img/types.jpg[]

"You need a lot of different types of people to make the world better."
-- Joe Louis


== Multimethods

Polymorphic dispatch. Define the name of the multimethod and the dispatch function:

    (defmulti encounter
      (fn dispatch [x y]
        [(:species x) (:species y)]))

Provide methods implementing functions to execute for a given dispatch value:

    (defmethod encounter [:bunny :lion] [x y] :run-away)
    (defmethod encounter [:lion :bunny] [x y] :eat)
    (defmethod encounter [:lion :lion] [x y] :fight)
    (defmethod encounter [:bunny :bunny] [x y] :mate)

* Between a case statement and a function definition
* Conditions under which to be called, and a function definition
* Given a dispatch result of `[:bunny :lion]`, the first method will be called
* `x` and `y` are inputs to the function
* Unused in this example


== Multimethods

Test data

    (def bunny1 {:species :bunny, :other :stuff})
    (def bunny2 {:species :bunny, :other :stuff})
    (def lion1 {:species :lion, :other :stuff})
    (def lion2 {:species :lion, :other :stuff})

Call the multimethod

    (encounter bunny1 bunny2)
    => :mate
    (encounter bunny1 lion1)
    => :run-away
    (encounter lion1 bunny1)
    => :eat
    (encounter lion1 lion2)
    => :fight

== Multimethods

Keywords are functions

Common to use a keyword as a dispatch function

    (defmulti draw :shape)


== Protocols

A named set of named methods and their signatures:

    (defprotocol AProtocol
      "A doc string for AProtocol abstraction"
      (bar [a b] "bar docs")
      (baz [a] [a b] [a b c] "baz docs"))

* No implementations are provided
* Yields a set of polymorphic functions and a protocol object
* The functions dispatch on the type of their first argument
* Must have at least one argument

deftype, defrecord, or reify support protocols directly:

    (defprotocol P
      (foo [x])
      (bar-me [x] [x y]))

    (deftype Foo [a b c]
      P
      (foo [x] a)
      (bar-me [x] b)
      (bar-me [x y] (+ c y)))

    (bar-me (Foo. 1 2 3) 42)
    => 45

    (foo
     (let [x 42]
       (reify P
         (foo [this] 17)
         (bar-me [this] x)
         (bar-me [this y] x))))
    => 17


== defprotocol

* Dynamic
* Generates a corresponding interface, with the same name as the protocol
* The interface will have methods corresponding to the protocol functions
* The protocol will automatically work with instances of the interface
* A Java client can implement the protocol-generated interface


== extend

    (extend AType
      AProtocol
       {:foo an-existing-fn
        :bar (fn [a b] ...)
        :baz (fn ([a]...) ([a b] ...)...)}
      BProtocol
        {...}
    ...)

* Extends the polymorphism of the protocol's methods
* Will call the supplied functions when an AType is provided as the first argument
* The `fn` can presume first argument is instanceof `AType`
* You can implement a protocol on `nil`
* Default implementation of protocol with `Object`


== extend-type

    (extend-type MyType
      Countable
        (cnt [c] ...)
      Foo
        (bar [x y] ...)
        (baz ([x] ...) ([x y zs] ...)))

Expands into:

    (extend MyType
      Countable
       {:cnt (fn [c] ...)}
      Foo
       {:baz (fn ([x] ...) ([x y zs] ...))
        :bar (fn [x y] ...)})


== Creating types with defrecord and deftype

* `deftype`, `defrecord`, and `reify` provide the mechanism for defining implementations of abstractions, and instances of those implementations.
* Resist the urge to use them to define 'structured data' as you would define classes or structures in other languages.
* It is preferred to use the built-in datatypes (vectors, maps, sets) to represent structured data.


== deftype

    (deftype Circle [radius])
    (deftype Square [length width])

    (Circle. 10)
    (Square. 5 11)

    (->Circle 10)
    (->Square 5 11)


== defrecord

	(ns training.core
	  (:import (java.net FileNameMap)))

    (defrecord Thing [a]
      FileNameMap
      (getContentTypeFor [this fileName] (str a "-" fileName)))

* Defines a record named `Thing`
* single field `a`
* Implements `FileNameMap` interface
* Implements `String getContentTypeFor(String fileName)`


== record constructor

    (def thing (Thing. "foo"))

    (instance? FileNameMap thing)
    => true

Call the method on the `thing` instance and pass `"bar"`:

    (.getContentTypeFor thing "bar")
    => "foo-bar"


== Specifications with clojure.spec

* Specifies the structure of data
* Validates data structures
* Can generate data
* Introduced into Clojure 1.9.0
* Update `project.clj` to the right version:

	[org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0"]

    (ns training.spec
      (:require [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]))


== Validation

    (s/valid? even? 10)
    => true

    (s/valid? string? 0)
    => false

Any single argument function is a valid predicate spec


== Common to use a set

Sets are functions, so can be used as predicates that match one or more literal values:

    (s/valid? #{:club :diamond :heart :spade} :club)
    => true


== Registration

Specs are registered using `s/def`

    (s/def ::suit #{:club :diamond :heart :spade})

A registered spec identifier can be used in place of a spec definition

    (s/valid? ::suit :club)
    => true


== Composing specs

    (s/def ::big-even (s/and int? even? #(> % 1000)))

    (s/valid? ::big-even 10)
    => false

    (s/valid? ::big-even 100000)
    => true


== Conforming

    (s/def ::name-or-id (s/or :name string? :id int?))

* Involves a choice during validity checking
* Each choice is tagged (`:name` and `:id`)

    (s/conform ::name-or-id "abc")
    => [:name "abc"]

    (s/conform ::name-or-id 100)
    => [:id 100]


== nil

    (string? nil)
    => false

To include `nil` as a valid value:

    (s/nilable string?)


== explain

Reports why a value does not conform to a spec

    (s/explain ::big-even 5)
    => val: 5 fails spec: ::big-even predicate: even?

== Maps

    (def email-regex
      #"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,63}$")
    (s/def ::email-type (s/and string? #(re-matches email-regex %)))
    (s/def ::acctid int?)
    (s/def ::first-name string?)
    (s/def ::last-name string?)
    (s/def ::email ::email-type)

    (s/def ::person (s/keys :req [::first-name ::last-name ::email]
                            :opt [::phone]))


== Validating maps

* required attributes are included
* every registered key has a conforming value

    (s/valid? ::person
      {::first-name "Elon"
       ::last-name "Musk"
       ::email "elon@example.com"})
    => true


== Unqualified

    (s/def :unq/person
      (s/keys :req-un [::first-name ::last-name ::email]
              :opt-un [::phone]))

    (s/valid? :unq/person
      {:first-name "Elon"
       :last-name "Musk"
       :email "elon@example.com"})
    => true

* Existing Clojure code not use namespaced keys
* req-un -> required unqualified keys
* opt-un -> optional unqualified keys


== map-of

    (s/def ::scores (s/map-of string? int?))
    (s/valid? ::scores {"Sally" 1000, "Joe" 500})
    => true

* Specifies a map with homogenous key and value predicates


== pre and post conditions

    (defn adder [x]
      #(+ x %))

    (s/fdef adder
      :args (s/cat :x number?)
      :ret (s/fspec :args (s/cat :y number?)
                    :ret number?)
      :fn #(= (-> % :args :x) ((:ret %) 0)))

* `:ret` declares that the returning function takes and returns a number
* `:fn` calling any adder with `0` should return `x`


== A game of cards

Model a game of cards:

    (def suit? #{:club :diamond :heart :spade})
    (def rank? (into #{:jack :queen :king :ace} (range 2 11)))
    (def deck (for [suit suit? rank rank?] [rank suit]))

    (s/def ::card (s/tuple rank? suit?))
    (s/def ::hand (s/* ::card))

    (s/def ::name string?)
    (s/def ::score int?)
    (s/def ::player (s/keys :req [::name ::score ::hand]))

    (s/def ::players (s/* ::player))
    (s/def ::deck (s/* ::card))
    (s/def ::game (s/keys :req [::players ::deck]))

    (def kenny
      {::name "Kenny Rogers"
       ::score 100
       ::hand []})
    (s/valid? ::player kenny)
    => true

Bad data produces errors

    (s/explain ::game
      {::deck deck
       ::players [{::name "Kenny Rogers"
                   ::score 100
                   ::hand [[2 :banana]]}]})
    => In: [::players 0 ::hand 0 1]
       val: :banana fails spec: ::card
       at: [::players ::hand 1]
       predicate: suit?


== Restricting deal to valid games

    (defn total-cards [{:keys [::deck ::players] :as game}]
      (apply + (count deck)
        (map #(-> % ::hand count) players)))

    (defn deal [game] ...)

    (s/fdef deal
      :args (s/cat :game ::game)
      :ret ::game
      :fn #(= (total-cards (-> % :args :game))
              (total-cards (-> % :ret))))


== Generators

* Specs are designed to act as generators
* Produce sample data that conforms to the spec
* Useful for property-based testing

Spec generators rely on the `test.check` as a development dependency in `project.clj`:

    :profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[org.clojure/test.check "0.9.0"]]}}

    (ns training.spec
      (:require [clojure.spec.gen.alpha :as gen]))


== gen

    (gen/generate (s/gen int?))
    => -959

* `gen` obtains the generator for a spec
* `generated` creates a value that conforms to the spec

    (gen/generate (s/gen ::player))
    => {:spec.examples.guide/name "sAt8r6t",
        :spec.examples.guide/score 233843,
        :spec.examples.guide/hand ([8 :spade] [5 :heart] [9 :club] [3 :heart])}

	(gen/generate (s/gen ::game))
    => {...}


== sample

    (gen/sample (s/gen string?))
    => ("" "" "" "" "8" "W" "" "G74SmCm" "K9sL9" "82vC")

    (gen/sample (s/gen #{:club :diamond :heart :spade}))
    => (:heart :diamond :heart :heart :heart :diamond :spade :spade :spade :club)


== int-in range

    (s/def ::roll (s/int-in 0 11))
    (gen/sample (s/gen ::roll))
    => (1 0 0 3 1 7 10 1 5 0)

== Instrumentation and Testing

    (ns training.spec
      (:require [clojure.spec.test.alpha :as stest]))

    (defn ranged-rand
      "Returns random int in range start <= rand < end"
      [start end]
      (+ start (long (rand (- end start)))))

    (s/fdef ranged-rand
      :args (s/and (s/cat :start int? :end int?)
                   #(< (:start %) (:end %)))
      :ret int?
      :fn (s/and #(>= (:ret %) (-> % :args :start))
                 #(< (:ret %) (-> % :args :end))))


== instrument

    (stest/instrument `ranged-rand)

* Fully-qualified symbol, use ```
* Provides validation for external uses of a function

    (ranged-rand 8 5)
    => CompilerException clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Call to #'spec.examples.guide/ranged-rand did not conform to spec

* `unstrument` to turn off


== check

* Generate arguments based on the `:args` spec
* Invoke the function
* Check that `:ret` and `:fn` specs were satisfied

    (stest/check `ranged-rand)
    => ({:spec #object[clojure.spec.alpha$fspec_impl ...],
         :clojure.spec.test.check/ret {:result true, :num-tests 1000, :seed 1466805740290},
         :sym spec.examples.guide/ranged-rand,
         :result true})

* `ranged-rand` contains a bug
* Run check several times to find it


== enumerate-namespace

    (stest/check (stest/enumerate-namespace 'testing.spec))

* Test all spec'ed functions in a namespace

    (stest/check)

* Check all spec'ed functions

== 11. Interacting with a Database

image:img/database.jpg[]

"You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data."
-- Daniel Keys Moran


== clojure.java.jdbc

    $ lein new messenger

`project.clj` dependencies:

    [org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.7.5"]
    [hsqldb/hsqldb "1.8.0.10"]

NOTE: we need the driver we plan to use to connect to a database

== Connecting

Require `jdbc` and configure a db connection url

    (ns messenger.core
      (:require [clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc]))

    (def db "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:testdb")


== Inserting

Create a table called testing

    (jdbc/execute! db
      "create table messages (message varchar(1024))")

Insert some rows

    (jdbc/insert-multi! db :messages
                        [{:message "Hello World"}
                         {:message "How now?"}])


== Querying

    (jdbc/query db ["select * from messages"])
    => ({:message "Hello World"}
        {:message "How now?"})


== Deleting

To selectively delete some data:

    (jdbc/delete! db :messages ["message like '%World%'"])
    (jdbc/query db ["select * from messages"])
    => ({:message "How now?"})

Now there is only one row remaining

== insert-multi!

    (jdbc/insert-multi! db :messages
                    [{:message "Nobody panic!!!"}
                     {:message "What in the world?"}
                     {:message "All is well."}])


== Parameterized query

    (defn search [s]
      (jdbc/query db
        ["select * from messages where message like ?" s]))

    (search "%How%")
    => ({:message "How now?"})

* String concatenation is susceptible to SQL injection
* Parameters are not part of the query; cannot perform SQL from malicious input


== Starting fresh

If you want to redo any steps, remember that you can always drop the table and start again

    (jdbc/execute! db "drop table messages")


== Solutions for SQL management

HoneySQL https://github.com/jkk/honeysql can be used to build SQL statements from data structures.
This is useful when you have to programmatically combine clauses to produce a final SQL statement.
For example if the user can check a checkbox to enable an additional clause in a search.
In such cases it is more convenient to use Clojure's capabilities for manipulating data structures.
However if you do not need to do such manipulation, I recommend using plain old SQL queries in their original text form, as you can run them interactively from an SQL prompt much easier that way.

== Challenge 4: Corgi Cover Database

Sending files around is proving to be problematic. Sometimes applications are lost or the results of the eligibility check are not communicated back to the customer. You have been tasked with creating a central source of truth that can be queried as to what applications have been submitted and processed.


== Part 1: Set up the schema

Using the database of your choice, set up an initial database for the Corgi Cover project. In the code, connect to the database and create the initial table required. You can use whatever schema you like, but the first requirement is to store the applications with exactly the same data as was retrieved from the file format in Challenge 2.


== Part 2: Populate the data

Modify the code to store the applications as they are processed, and the result of the eligibility check.


== Part 3: Write a spec

Ensure that all records processed from the files meets your expectations for required fields. Write a spec that explicitly defines what should be in the applications. Validate the spec on the incoming records.


== Part 4: Extending to Poodle Protection

Insuricorp is about to launch a new policy called “Poodle Protection”. Soon they will be processing applications with completely new rules. Set up a multimethod to handle “Poodle Protection” applications differently from “Corgi Cover” applications. For now the only difference with the rules from “Corgi Cover” is that “Poodle Protection” is available in different states: California (CA), Florida (FL), Wyoming (WY), and Hawaii (HI).
