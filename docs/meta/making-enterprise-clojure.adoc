== What are you waiting for?

.Waiting patiently for Clojure adoption in the workplace
image::talk/corgi-waiting.jpg[Corgi waiting at door]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Just among us friends, the potential for Clojure to take over the programming world is obvious.
* But... why isn’t everybody using it yet?
* My name is Timothy Pratley, and this talk is titled "What are you waiting for?"
* This isn't a "why Clojure" talk; most of you are here because you already know and love Clojure
* My goal today is to encourage you to hurry up and start using Clojure at work
* I will be introducing an open source training course called Enterprise Clojure Training
* My collaborator Elango will be speaking about his experiences using and teaching Clojure
* Why did we build a course you might ask?

image::talk/idea-asciidoctor.png[]

== Chrome live reloading

* Renders in the browser direct from `.adoc`
* Updates when the file changes

== Slides

* Based on RevealJS
* `asciidoctor-revealjs` plugin
* Requires a build step

== Event Notify Test Runner (entr)

* Watches files
* Runs a command on change
* Install with brew or apt
* `./watch.sh`

== Deploying

* Github Pages build `adoc` via Jekyll
* But not slides...
* TravisCI auto-build/deploy
* Change text, push, done!

== Training options

https://clojure.org/community/training

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Good options but...
* Didn't provide training material I could use
* Not very Enterprise

== Observations

.Learning Clojure is challenging
image::talk/corgi-training.jpg[Corgi jumping a bar]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* I've had the opportunity to help people learn Clojure through this course
* And through pairing with people at work
* I'll take a bit of time here to share some observations on the learning process
* I believe that anyone can learn Clojure
* But it is definitely a challenge
--

== Change of thinking required

.Woha, I get it!
image::talk/corgi-lights.png[Corgi in lights]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* A mental shift is required
* Think in sequences
* Think in maps, sets, vectors
* Think in aggregation
* Everything is a function
* Passing lots of arguments or data is O.K.
* Took me a long time
* See it in others
* Some people get it quickly, some never do
* Check your preconception at the door
* Embrace the idioms
--

== Simple ain't easy

"I had high hopes for Clojure for a while, but they're fairly user-hostile, even if they think (and loudly assert) that they aren't."
-- Steve Yegge

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It's easy to forget our own path to enlightenment
* New users face difficult obstacles
* Example: just installing Java, Leiningen, IDEA
* Java - which version?
Quite easy to choose the wrong thing
* Lein - doesn't work on Windows
* IDEA - make sure you configure your SDK!
- And get Cursive!
- And now your parenthesis are out of your control
* Objectively I think it is fair to call Clojure user hostile
- Error messages
- Tooling setup
* We can see beyond these difficulties
* But a little empathy goes a long way with beginners
* They often blocked with something easily resolved by a question
* As a teacher it is important to be approachable and sympathetic
* Part of that is acknowledging that things aren't perfect
--

== Tips for learning

* Focus on the language first (the mental shift will come later)
* Delay investing in tools and editors
* Join the community, find a teacher, ask questions
* *Practise*
* *Read code*
* 4Clojure
* Read and follow the style guide

== Join the community

* ClojureVerse
* StackOverflow [clojure] [clojurescript]
* Google group: Clojure
* Clojurians

"I am so happy with, and proud of, the Clojure community.
People are helpful, and respectful, and positive."
-- Rich Hickey

[state=title]
== At work

.How did I get here?
image::corgi.jpg[Corgi with tie and glasses]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* My goal today is to encourage you to hurry up and start using Clojure at work
* Part one of this talk was about providing a course
* Part two is sharing my path
* And to do that I must first begin with how I came to Clojure

== Rewind << 2007

.My first encounter with Lisp
image::talk/corgi-encounter.jpg[Corgi encounters budgie]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* In 2007 I was a bit of a know it all kind of programmer
* Hiring an engineer, their code submission was... concise, elegant
* I didn’t understand it
* It was in a language I didn’t know
* I thought I knew all the languages: C, C++ and Java
* It must be one of those weird languages we dabbled with at university like prolog or haskell
* It was Lisp
* Well fine, I can program in any language, I’ll just learn the constructs and...
* Six months later I was ready to put lisp back in it’s box
* I’d worked through SICP and onlisp, and written small programs
* There was an elegance to the concepts,
* but applying them to the kinds of computation I wanted to do was not practical
* Then this happened:

Hello,

As someone interested in Foil or jFli, I thought you might want to know about my latest project - Clojure, a dialect of Lisp for the JVM. It's currently alpha, but fairly complete.
I'm looking for some feedback from some intrepid folks willing to kick the tires.
http://clojure.sourceforge.net/

Please use the Google group for feedback:
http://groups.google.com/group/clojure

Regards and thanks,

Rich

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* I was instantly hooked
* I could build stuff!
* Even render 3d images!
* Fnil - completely new way of thinking, solves a real problem in an unexpected way.
* Not really an option for my day job
* Clojure was for personal projects

== 2010

image::talk/corgi-team.jpg[Corgis carrying a branch together]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Managing a team of 12 people building logistics software
* Using C#
* Agile
* I build custom reports and prototypes in Clojure
* Technical challenges would be so much easier in Clojure
* But how could I transition my team over?
* I didn't think it was possible on my own
--

== Why didn't I convert my team to Clojure?

.I can't do this on my own
image::talk/corgi-asleep-at-vet.jpg[Corgi asleep at the vet]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* What prevents companies from sliding into Clojure en masse?
* What prevented me from converting my team to Clojure?
* Main obstacle; How could I get my team up and running on Clojure quickly
* It felt like it was too much to do on my own
* Needed training, another expert, C-level buy in
* It's hard to believe that you can switch languages effectively without some help
* You do need some help
* What can we do about it?
--

== Many people don't know Clojure

.Looking different can feel weird
image::talk/corgi-weird.jpeg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It's natural to be suspicious of what we don't know
* They have real concerns
- Is it really better?
- Is this for "regular" programmers?
- Can we learn it?
- Who will support it?
- Can we hire people?
- Why are you wasting your time on something so obscure?
* Explaining isn't enough
--

== What are *developers* waiting for?

.Jobs!
image::talk/clojure-jobs.png[Clojure job listings]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* In 2010 there were not many Clojure jobs
* Now there are
* The Google group has topics labeled [JOB] (employers take note that anyone can post these freely)
* Clojure for the Brave and True runs a jobs board
* Clojure/conj sponsors and attendees are often recruiting
--

== What are *companies* waiting for?

.Developers!
image::talk/corgi-developer.jpg[Corgi using a laptop]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* There was a perception that it is hard to hire for Clojure
* That's probably still true if you use the standard recruitment agency approach
* If you use the channels I mentioned on the previous slide you will get a lot of interest
* Clojure is a perk, not a barrier
* You don't have to hire for Clojure specifically; good programmers will become experts very quickly
--

== What are *learners* waiting for?

.A market!
image::talk/corgi-student.png[Corgi student]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The first question a beginner asks is which language should I learn?
* The standard answer right now is JavaScript, Java, Python
* Clojure is a better tools for thought
- Maps/sets/vectors
- Concise algorithm expression
- Focus on important concepts
- Less baggage and distractions
- Reach mastery of algorithmic concepts faster
* Supply and demand is not as simple as "most used"
- The most popular market is also the most average market
- Supply and demand does not favor the most popular
- You will benefit from an imbalance in supply to demand found in smaller markets
* The future is ... the future
- I have used a different programming language in every job I have worked
- It's not certain what language you will be writing in the future
- It's not valuable to avoid learning more than one language
- Good employers value skills, knowledge and culture over specific technology experience
- Optimize for computer science mastery, not basics
- Choose a language that helps you grow
--

== What are *employees* waiting for?

.A greenfield!
image::talk/corgi-on-field.jpg[Corgi on a green field]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Room to do things right
* Figure out what that means
* But why not do some boring stuff too?
--

== What are *employers* waiting for?

.A framework!
image::talk/corgi-in-crate.jpg[Corgi in dog crate]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Something to start with and add to
* Get going quickly
* Structure
* That's all totally possible

.Enterprise facing Clojure startup
image::talk/corgi-herding-ducks.jpg[Corgi herding ducks]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Joined a Clojure startup
* Built an entirely new Clojure/ClojureScript core product
* Clojure scales; large teams, large codebase, heavy data throughput
* Built initial products in a month
* Training people wasn't hard
* Recruiting was easy
* Same concepts and idioms in the frontend and backend
* Moving across the codebase and between teams was easy
* Maintainable

.Customer facing Clojure startup
image::talk/suiteness.png[Suiteness logo]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Suiteness is the place to find rooms that connect to suites for half the price of a 2 bedroom suite.
* So you can stretch out without stretching your budget.
* Or you can find all the space and affordability of a vacation rental with the amenities of a hotel.
* Our biggest users are families and group events.
* Built on Clojure/ClojureScript
- make recruiting easy
- productive tech stack

== Is Clojure Enterprise?

image::talk/popularity.png[Language popularity]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* It is for me
* I get to use it at work
* I've built Enterprise Systems with it
* Many large companies use it
* Companies are recruiting for Clojure experience
* It's getting popular
--

== Or not?

image::talk/most-used-jvm.jpg[Most used JVM languages]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Still a niche
* Secret weapon, and that's O.K.
* Value principles over popularity
- simplicity
- thinking
- community
--

== Does it matter?

* Clojure makes me happy
* I want you to be happy too
* There are obstacles
* There is uncertainty
* There is opportunity

== Clojure adoption

.A challenging knot to approach
image::talk/corgi-rope.jpg[Corgi pulling a rope]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Clojure adoption seems like a challenging knot to approach
* In 333 B.C. Alexander the Great marched his army into Gordium in modern day Turkey
* He encountered an ancient wagon tied with knots so tightly entangled that it was impossible to see how they were fastened
* Tradition held that the wagon had once belonged to Gordius, the father of the celebrated King Midas
* An oracle had declared that anyone who could unravel its elaborate knots was destined to become ruler of all of Asia
* Alexander proclaimed "It makes no difference how they are loosed," drew his sword and sliced the knot in half with a single stroke
* The Gordian Knot story is one to take inspiration from
* Don't over-think it, see past implied limitations, be decisive
--

== Clojure is a great choice for your company

* Books
* Great community
* Experts
* Training

TIP: *Build better stuff faster*

== So what are you waiting for?

.Start using Clojure already!

* Hopefully my training course can give you the confidence to get started
* I'd love to help you get a strong start
