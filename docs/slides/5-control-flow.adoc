== 5. Control Flow

"Control your own destiny or someone else will."
-- Jack Welch


== Conditionals: if

[source,eval-clojure]
    (if (pos? 1)
      "one is positive"
      "or is it?")
    ;=> "one is positive"

* Chooses between two options
* Returns a result
* Only one branch is evaluated
* A function call evaluates all arguments


== Truthiness

* Booleans: `true` and `false`
* `nil` means nothing and is considered false in logical tests
* Anything else is truthy

[source,eval-clojure]
    (if 5
      "it's five!"
      "no problem")
    ;=> "it's five!"


== Use do to group multiple statements

[source,eval-clojure]
    (if (pos? 1)
      (do (prn "hi")
          "one is positive")
      "or is it?")
    ;;; "hi"
    ;=> "one is positive"


== Conditionals: when

[source,eval-clojure]
    (when (pos? 1)
      (prn "multiple expressions allowed")
      :ok)
    ;;; multiple expressions allowed
    ;=> :ok

* When test fails, nothing is evaluated
* When test passes, the entire body is evaluated
* Returns the last expression as a result


== Conditionals: cond

[source,eval-clojure]
    (def x {:cake 1})
    (cond (= x 1) "one"
          (= x :cake) "the cake is a lie"
          (map? x) "it's a map!"
          :else "not sure what it is")
    ;=> "it's a map!"

* Multiple branches
* `:else` is not special, keywords are truthy
* See also `condp` and `case`


== Conditionals are special forms

Built in primitives, not functions

`def`, `let`, `quote` and `fn` are special forms

Arguments are not evaluated

[source,eval-clojure]
    (if (= 1 2)
      (prn "a")
      (prn "b"))
    ;;; "b"
    ;=> nil


== Reminder: functions evaluate all arguments

[source,eval-clojure]
    (defn if-fn [condition a b]
      (if condition a b))
    (if-fn (= 1 2)
      (prn "a")
      (prn "b"))
    ;;; a
    ;;; b
    ;=> nil


== Macros are also special

`or` is a macro

[source,eval-clojure]
    (or true (println "Hello"))
    ;=> true

Arguments are not evaluated

Macros are used to implement and extend Clojure syntax


== Macros replace forms at compile time

    (or true false)

Expands to:

    (let [a true]
      (if a
          a
          (let [b false]
            (if b
                b)))))


== Macros and special forms are not functions

[source,eval-clojure]
    (apply or [true false true])
    ;;; CompilerException: Can't take value of a macro


[source,eval-clojure]
    (apply if [true :a :b])
    ;;; CompilerException: Unable to resolve symbol: if

WARNING: Macros cannot be passed as arguments to functions


== Identifying special forms and macros

* Remember the special forms:
  `if`, `do`, `let`, `quote`, `var`, `fn`, `loop`, `recur`, `throw`, `try`
* Control flow forms: `cond`, `or`, `and`, `when`
* Navigate to source: `def`, `defn`, `defmacro`
* See `:macro` in Metadata
* Documentation

NOTE: Writing macros is covered later in the course


== Recursion

    (defn sum-up [coll result]
      (if (empty? coll)
        result
        (sum-up (rest coll)
                (+ result (first coll)))))

Functions that invoke themselves are recursive


== Tail Call Optimization

Recursion without consuming the stack

    (defn sum-up-with-recur [coll result]
      (if (empty? coll)
        result
        (recur (rest coll) (+ result (first coll)))))

* Recur can only occur where a function returns
* Current frame will return the result of the next call
* No further calculations needed
* Current frame can be released


== Loops

    (loop [a 0
           b 1]
      (if (< b 1000)
        (recur b (+ a b))
        a))

* Loop establishes bindings
* Allows recur to the start of the loop


== Exception handling

Special forms `try` `catch` `finally` and `throw`

    (try
      (inc "cat")
      (catch Exception e
        (println "cat cannot be incremented"))
      (finally
        (println "always"))

            (>= score 60) "D"
            :else "F"))

         (recur (* acc n) (dec n)))))

    (deftest factorial2-test
