== 4. Testing with clojure.test

image:img/testing.jpg[]

"The problem is not that testing is the bottleneck. The problem is that you don’t know what’s in the bottle."
-- Michael Bolton


== deftest

[source,eval-clojure]
    (ns my.namespace
      (:require [clojure.test
                 :refer [deftest is run-tests]]))
    (deftest my-test
      (prn "My test ran")
      (is (= 1 1)))
    (my-test)
    ;;; "My test ran"
    ;=> nil

Tests are functions with no input arguments

Tests make assertions: `(is (= 1 1))`


== Failing tests

[source,eval-clojure]
    (deftest my-failing-test
      (prn "My failing test ran")
      (is (= 1 2)))
    (my-failing-test)
    ;;; "My failing test ran"
    ;;; FAIL in (my-failing-test)


== Defining tests with deftest

Can define tests in any namespace

Convention: `*test*` dir mirrors `*src*` dir; append `*test*`


|===
|`*test*/training/a_test.clj`
|`*src*/training/a.clj`
|===

NOTE: The namespace `training.a-test` contains tests for functions from `training.a`


== Refer all

Common to refer all symbols from `clojure.test` for convenience:

    (ns training.my-namespace-test
      (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]))
    (deftest ...)

vs

    (ns training.my-namespace-test
      (:require [clojure.test :as test]))
    (test/deftest ...)


== Running tests from the REPL

[source,eval-clojure]
    (run-tests)
    ;;; "My test ran"
    ;;; "My failing test ran"
    ;;; Ran 0 tests containing 0 assertions.
    ;;; 0 failures, 0 errors.
    ;=> {:test 1, :pass 0, :fail 0, :error 0, :type :summary}

Runs all tests in the current namespace


== Test specific namespaces:

    (run-tests 'training.my-namespace
               'training.other-namespace)


== Command line testing

    $ lein test

    "My test ran"
    "My failing test ran"
    Ran 0 tests containing 0 assertions.
    0 failures, 0 errors.

Runs all tests in a project


== lein-test-refresh

* Reloads code and runs tests when you save a file
* Leiningen plugin

Add lein-test-refresh to your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

    {:user
     {:plugins
      [[com.jakemccrary/lein-test-refresh "0.22.0"]]}}


== lein-test-refresh

Alternatively as a `project.clj` dependency:

    (defproject sample
      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]]
      :profiles
      {:dev
       {:plugins
        [[com.jakemccrary/lein-test-refresh "0.22.0"]]}})


== Using lein-test-refresh

	$ lein test-refresh

Watches for changes from the command line

Change `my-test` to print a new message

Tests are re-run as soon as you save the file

	(deftest my-test
	  (prn "My test ran immediately"))

Use lein-test-refresh like a REPL

Test more


== Assertions

	(deftest inc-adds-one-test
	  (is (= 2 (inc 1))))

	=> Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions.
    0 failures, 0 errors.

* `(= expected actual)`
* Expected: value literal
* Actual: result of invoking the function under test


== Failures

	(deftest broken-test
	  (is (= 1 (inc 1))))

	=> FAIL in (broken-test)
    expected: (= 1 (inc 1))
      actual: (not (= 1 2))


== Can use any truthy assertion

    (deftest odd-test
      (is (odd? 1)))

    (deftest create-test
      (is (create-thing)))


== Describing the assertions

    (deftest pythag-test
      (is (= (* 5 5)
             (+ (* 3 3) (* 4 4)))
          "The square of the hypotenuse
          is equal to the sum of the squares
          of the other two sides"))


== Comparing complex values

    expected: (= {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:fo :bar, :baz :quux})
      actual: (not (= {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:fo :bar, :baz :quux}))

Huh?

    expected: {:foo :bar, :baz :quux}
      actual: {:fo :bar, :baz :quux}
        diff: - {:foo :bar}
              + {:fo :bar}

`pjstadig/humane-test-output` (or `venantius/ultra`)


== Humane test output

`~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

    {:user
     {:dependencies
      [[pjstadig/humane-test-output "0.8.3"]]
      :injections
       [(require 'pjstadig.humane-test-output)
        (pjstadig.humane-test-output/activate!)]}}


== Grouping assertions

    (deftest math-test
      (testing "Basic math"
        (is (odd? 1))
        (is (= 2 (inc 1))))
      (testing "Pythagoras"
        (is (= (* 5 5)
               (+ (* 3 3) (* 4 4)))
            "The square of the hypotenuse
            is equal to the sum of the squares
            of the other two sides"))


== are

    (are [x y] (= x y)
         2 (+ 1 1)
         4 (* 2 2))

Concisely expresses multiple assertions

WARNING: Disadvantages

* Easy to make an error in the syntax
* Overly terse
* Line numbers are not preserved (harder to find the failing test)


== Should throw an exception

    (defn maybe-inc [x]
      (if (= 42 x)
        (throw (ex-info "oh no" {}))
        (inc x)))

    (deftest test-maybe-inc-throws
      (is (thrown? Exception
            (maybe-inc 42)))
      (is (thrown-with-msg? Exception #"oh no"
            (maybe-inc 42))))


== Test fixtures

    (use-fixtures :each
      (fn print-enter-exit [tests]
        (println "before")
        (tests)
        (println "after")))

* A fixture is just a function
* Takes a test and calls it (tests are functions)
* Set up and tear down resources (database connections etc)
* `:each` means run for every test in the namespace

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Test runner will call the fixture

* prints “before”
* executes the tests in the namespace
* prints “after”
--


== Every vs once

    (use-fixtures :once
      (fn capture-prints [f]
        (with-out-str (f))))

* This fixture captures output, prevents clutter
* `:once` per namespace


== Fixtures

* Common use case is when doing database tests
* Wrap the test execution inside a transaction
* Rollback after the test completes
* Avoids the need to clean up data


== Mocking

    (defn post [url]
      {:body (str "Hello world")})

    (deftest test-post
      (with-redefs [str (fn [& args]
                           "Goodbye world")]
        (is (= {:body "Goodbye world"}
               (post "http://service.com/greet")))))

NOTE: `let` does not suffice, `str` is outside of scope


== Mocking

* Replace any var using `with-redefs`
* Disable dependencies during the test
* Isolate particular behaviors
* Test exceptional conditions
** always throw
** never throw


== Debugging

Print out an intermediary values

    (defn shazam [a b]
      (/ 1 (+ a b) (+ a (* a b))))

What is `(+ a (* a b))` evaluating to? `(doto ... (prn))`

    (defn shazam [a b]
      (/ 1 (+ a b) (doto (+ a (* a b)) (prn "***"))))

    (shazam 1 2)
    => 3 "***"
       1/9

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* `prn` will not work, always returns `nil`
* `doto` causes side-effect to occur, and return the original argument
--


== doto

Also useful for Java interop:

    (doto (new java.util.HashMap)
      (.put "a" 1)
      (.put "b" 2))
    => {"a" 1, "b" 2}

We get the constructed object, with side-effects applied


== Debugging

* Ask the REPL questions
* Build small incremental functions
* Write tests


== Workflow demo

    (defn pythag [a b]
      (Math/sqrt (+ (* a a) (* b b))))

    (deftest test-pythag
      (is (= 5 (pythag 4 3)))
      (is (= 13 (pythag 12 5))))

    (defn post [url]

    (deftest test-post
      (let [c (atom 0)]
        (with-redefs [str (fn [& args]
                            (swap! c inc)
                            "Goodbye world")]
          (post "http://service.com/greet")
          (post "http://service.com/greet")
          (post "http://service.com/greet")
          (is (= 3 @c)))))
